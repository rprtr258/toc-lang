### How do this project's goals compare with Flying Logic?

[Flying Logic](https://flyinglogic.com) is the most advanced tool available for TOC Thinking Process diagramming, and we don't aim to change that. As concurrently conceived, our differentiators are:

**Entry level**: If you are collaborating with people new to TOC, it's unlikely they will buy a proprietary tool to get started. A free online solution for simple use cases will help introduce them.

**Textual representation**: A text format enables version control, generating multiple output formats, and potentially correlating multiple diagrams together as in [Logical Thinking Process](https://www.marris-consulting.com/en/our-expertise/logical-thinking-process).
